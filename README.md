# squid-proxy
This is an automatic script to install Squid-proxy with basic authentication for Linux Ubuntu.
This script is already tested and working in Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS & 18.04 LTS.
## Installation
1. Download or clone this repo.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dnwandana/squid-proxy.git
    cd squid-proxy
    ```
2. Make the file `install-squid.sh` is executable.
    ```bash
    chmod +x install-squid.sh
    ```
3. Execute `install-squid.sh`
    ```bash
    ./install-squid.sh
    ```
### Installation note
- You'll be prompted for first user to use the proxy-server. You can leave it blank (add user later).
- To add another user you can type :
  ```bash
  sudo htpasswd /etc/squid/passwd username
  ```
  ^ Change username to your preferred username.
## Verify the Squid service status
- To verify if the squid service is running, you can type :
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl status squid
  ```
  You should see the `active (running)` status like this.
  ```bash
  Loaded: .....
  Active: active (running) since DATE; TIME ago
  Docs: ....
  ```
- or you can check running Squid proxy port using following command :
  ```bash
  sudo netstat -ntlp
  ```
  By default, Squid runs on port `3128`. You should see the result like this.
  ```bash
  Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
  tcp6       0      0 :::3128                 :::*                    LISTEN      14768/(squid-1)
  ```
## Test Squid proxy
We're gonna test Squid proxy authentication using curl. You can use the following syntax :
```bash
curl -x [SQUID_SERVER_IP]:[SQUID_PORT] --proxy-user [USERNAME]:[USER_PASSWORD] -I [SITE]
```
For Example :
```bash
curl -x 192.168.0.100:3128 --proxy-user testuser:P@ssw0rd -I https://google.com/
```
You'll see the following results :
- Success
  ```bash
  HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
  ```
- Authentication Error
  ```bash
  HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required
  .....
  .....
  Received HTTP code 407 from proxy after CONNECT
  ```
That's it now you're ready to go to use Squid proxy for any reason!
