# Manual Installation Squid-proxy
This page will help you to manual install Squid-proxy with Basic authentication in Linux Ubuntu. This script is already tested and working in Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS & 18.04 LTS with Squid Cache: Version 3.5.12.

Before you follow the instruction below, you can see my Simple Squid Configuration with Basic Authentication [here](squid.conf "Simple Squid Configuration with Basic Authentication").
## Basic Installation
1. First thing we need to do is update package list and upgrade new versions of existing packages on the machine.
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
2. Then we install Squid service.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install squid -y
   ```
3. After the installation is finished, we need to start and enable Squid service.
   ``` bash
   sudo systemctl start squid
   sudo systemctl enable squid
   ```
## Verify The Squid Service Status
To verify if the squid service is running, you execute following command :
```bash
sudo systemctl status squid
```
You should see the `active (running)` status like this.
```bash
Loaded: .....
Active: active (running) since DATE; TIME ago
Docs: ....
```
By default, Squid service is running on port `3128`. But you can change Squid port inside Squid configuration. 
```bash
sudo nano \etc\squid\squid.conf
```
Search for `http_port 3128`, and then change to custom port that you want. If you change the default Squid port, dont forget to restart the service, using following command :
```bash
sudo systemctl restart squid
```
and then, to make sure Squid service is running on port `3128` or your custom Squid port, you check using the following command :
```bash
sudo netstat -ntlp | grep :[PORT]
```
Example to check if there is a running service on port `3128` :
```bash
sudo netstat -ntlp | grep :3128
```
You should see the result like this.
```bash
tcp6       0      0 :::3128                 :::*                    LISTEN      108936/(squid-1)
```
## Enable Squid ACL for Internet Connectivity
By default, all the incoming connection to the proxy server will be denied. We need to change a few Squid configurations, so the server can accept connections from other hosts.

Open the Squid configuration file.
```bash
sudo nano \etc\squid\squid.conf
```
Search for `http_access allow localnet`. By default, it should be commented out. Uncomment it.
still in the Squid configuration file. We need to add ACL for localnet using the following format :
```bash
acl localnet src [SOURCE-IP-RANGE]
```
Example, you can whitelist the source IP ranges in the following ways :
- Single IP Source : [192.168.0.10]
- Range of IP Source : [192.168.0.1-192.168.0.255]

This is my ACL configuration.
```bash
acl localnet src 0.0.0.1-0.255.255.255
```
Save the file, and dont forget to restart the service.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart squid
```
## Test Squid Proxy
We're gonna test Squid proxy authentication using curl. You can use the following command :
```bash
curl -x [SQUID_SERVER_IP]:[SQUID_PORT] -I [SITE]
```
For Example :
```bash
curl -x 192.168.0.100:3128 -I https://google.com/
```
You'll see the following result :
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
```
## Setup Squid With Basic Authentication
The previous method would allow anonymous proxy usage. To prevent this, we can set up basic authentication using a username and password.
1. First we need to install apache-utils.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2-utils -y
   ```
2. Create a passwd file and change the ownership to proxy user.
   ```bash
   sudo touch /etc/squid/passwd
   sudo chown proxy /etc/squid/passwd
   ```
3. Next we need to create user using the following command, change `PROXY_USER` to your prefer username. Then you will be prompt for a password. Provide a secure password.
   ```bash
   sudo htpasswd /etc/squid/passwd [PROXY_USER]
   ```
4. Open and modify Squid configuration file.
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/squid/squid.conf
   ```
5. Search for `auth_param basic program` uncomment it and then put the following Squid configuration.
   ```bash
   auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/passwd
   auth_param basic children 5
   auth_param basic realm Squid Basic Authentication
   auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours
   acl auth_users proxy_auth REQUIRED
   ```
6. Save the file and restart Squid service.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart squid
   ```
## Test Squid Proxy with Basic Authentication
We're gonna test Squid proxy authentication using curl. You can use the following command :
```bash
curl -x [SQUID_SERVER_IP]:[SQUID_PORT] --proxy-user [USERNAME]:[USER_PASSWORD] -I [SITE]
```
For Example :
```bash
curl -x 192.168.0.100:3128 --proxy-user testuser:P@ssw0rd -I https://google.com/
```
You'll see the authentication error if the authentication details are not passed properly.
```bash
HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required
.....
.....
Received HTTP code 407 from proxy after CONNECT
```
Otherwise, you'll see the following result :
```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
```
That's it now you're ready to go to use Squid proxy for any reason!
